# AI Stock Market Prediction

Welcome to the **AI Stock Market Prediction** repository! This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict stock market trends based on historical data. By leveraging techniques like time series forecasting, sentiment analysis, and feature engineering, the goal is to build a predictive model that can offer insights into stock price movements.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices or trends in the stock market. By analyzing historical stock data, as well as additional data sources such as news sentiment and economic indicators, this project aims to build a model that can forecast stock prices for better investment decisions.

### Key Features:
- **Time-series analysis**: Applying algorithms such as ARIMA and LSTM to analyze past stock prices and predict future movements.
- **Sentiment analysis**: Using news articles and social media sentiment to gauge the market mood and impact stock prices.
- **Data integration**: Combining historical price data with external datasets (e.g., economic indicators, company news, etc.) for comprehensive predictions.

## Project Structure

The project follows a well-organized structure:

```

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

The `data/` directory contains the necessary datasets for stock market prediction. It includes:

- **Raw data**: Historical stock prices (e.g., from Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage).
- **Processed data**: Cleaned and transformed data ready for model training.
- **External data**: Additional datasets like news articles, economic indicators, or company reports that could influence stock prices.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis, model training, and prediction generation. Some key notebooks include:

- **Stock Price Forecasting.ipynb**: Time-series forecasting using ARIMA and LSTM.
- **Sentiment Analysis.ipynb**: Analyzing market sentiment based on news articles or social media.

## Source Code

The `src/` folder contains the main Python scripts for the project:

- **data_preprocessing.py**: Handles data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
- **feature_engineering.py**: Includes the creation of additional features such as sentiment scores and technical indicators.
- **model.py**: Contains functions for training machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) and making predictions.
- **utils.py**: Provides utility functions for data manipulation, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Running the Project

1. **Prepare the Data**: Run the data preprocessing scripts in `data_preprocessing.py` to clean and organize your data for model training.
2. **Train the Model**: Use the functions in `model.py` to train your machine learning models. Choose between ARIMA for classical time-series forecasting or LSTM for deep learning-based prediction.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict stock prices and evaluate the performance using test data.
4. **Visualize Results**: Use the provided visualization functions to display predicted trends and compare them to actual market movements.

## Results

The project includes a folder for output:

- **predictions/**: Contains the predicted stock prices or trends, saved as CSV files.
- **reports/**: Generated reports, such as stock price prediction performance graphs.
- **logs/**: Logs detailing model training and prediction processes.
