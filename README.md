```

## Installation

To run the project, you need to install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data

Each project includes several types of data:

- **Raw data**: The original, unprocessed data.
- **Processed data**: The cleaned and transformed data used for modeling and analysis.
- **External data**: Any additional data sources (e.g., weather, promotions) that may be relevant to the analysis.

The data directories for each project can be found in the `data/` folder.

## Notebooks

The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks that showcase various analyses, visualizations, and machine learning models used for the respective project.

## Source Code

The `src/` directory includes Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, and utility functions. Here's a quick overview:

- **data_preprocessing.py**: Handles data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
- **feature_engineering.py**: Contains functions for feature creation and transformation.
- **model.py**: Includes the model training and prediction logic.
- **utils.py**: Contains utility functions, such as handling missing values and data normalization.

## Running the Project

Each project may have different steps for running the model and performing the analysis. For example, you can start with data preprocessing, then move to model training and prediction. Refer to the specific project's notebook or source code for detailed instructions.
